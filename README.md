#  ðŸ”­ .... Iâ€™m currently working on . . 



## 1.  firmware based rootkits

       ;; Also Preparing for taking the OSCP,
       ;; after I have completed & earned a C - Professional Certification (3 of 7 courses complete)

### ... Firmware Reverse Engineering + Backdoor Implants of it. All progress will be available here on GitHub.
    - SSD Firmware Reverse Engineering,
        - As well as for HDD Firmware.
        - To be able to present a POC (Proof Of Concept) of the following:
        1. SSD and HDD Firmware backdoor 
        (non-erasable persistent backdoor that is capable of 
        (but not limited to): 
           - executing reverse shells(bash,cmd,lua,python,ruby and perl to begin with)
           - re-writing the MBR to achieve master-boot-record execution.
           - rf - receiver and transmitter - I got especially inspired by some NSA Projects on this one.
           - Self-Replication via USB and Over the network, as well as
               - over:
               - WIFI
               - RF(as stated above)
               - Bluetooth
                   
## 2. Technical Writeups in progress:
