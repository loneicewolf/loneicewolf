#  ðŸ”­ .... Iâ€™m currently working on . . 

## 1. Reverse engineering of [implant] Howlermonkey.

Will share eventually. Right now, OSCP goes first.

## 2.  firmware-based Rootkits


### ... Firmware Reverse Engineering + Backdoor Implants of it.
#### All progress will be available here on GitHub.

- SSD Firmware Reverse Engineering,
- As well as for HDD Firmware.
- To be able to present a POC (Proof Of Concept) of the following:

        1. SSD and HDD Firmware backdoor 
        (non-erasable persistent backdoor that is capable of (but not limited to):
        
           - executing reverse shells(bash,cmd,lua,python,ruby and perl to begin with)
           - re-writing the MBR to achieve master-boot-record execution.
           - rf - receiver and transmitter - I got especially inspired by some NSA Projects on this one.
           - Self-Replication via USB and Over the network, as well as
               - WIFI
               - RF(as stated above)
               - Bluetooth

### 2. Technical Writeups in progress:

  - HDD/SSD Firmware Based Rootkits. Writeup(s) [70% / 100%]
