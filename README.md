**Hello!**
You will mostly find stuff related to, reverse engineering, malware and exploit development. and just about anything that is related to info security.

I am William Martens, I am as well Swedish.
And I have a speech disorder(stuttering).


- `failed my 3rd OSCP Exam`
- `but will try` even harder next time. Note; I will do CompTIA courses before trying the OSCP retake. as I seem to be not prepared enough (will be a Google course, A+, Net+, Sec+ (likely))
